# Commands

Custom slash commands for the hustle plugin.

## Creating Commands

Each `.md` file in this directory becomes a slash command:

**Example: `hello.md`**
```markdown
Say hello and show the current date and time.
```

Usage: `/hello`

## Organization

You can organize commands in subdirectories:
- `commands/dev/test.md` → `/test` (subdirectory shown in description)
